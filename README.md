# Course Starting in Deep Learning 
> Here is a course that I have created to teach an introduction to deep learning. Besides that, all details are needed to start in this field, such as how neural networks work, how made tensor operations, etc 

> In this repository, you'll find how to use GPU to run your neural networks on your own desktop, or if you prefer you can run them on Google Colab.
